# META RULES: UNIVERSAL PROJECT PRINCIPLES

## 1. Project Structure and Organization
- Maintain clear hierarchical organization of rules and documentation.
- Separate concerns into logical domains (Core, Workflow, Patterns).
- **Security Isolation:** Enforce strict logical/physical separation of user data (Workspace-based).

## 2. Development Philosophy
- **Value-Driven:** Every feature must contribute to API reliability and developer productivity.
- **Reliability First:** Data integrity and consistency are paramount - zero data loss tolerance.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Design for future cloud backup, multi-device sync, and horizontal scaling.

## 3. Problem-Solving Methodology
- Define problems clearly before attempting solutions.
- Analyze context and scope thoroughly.
- **Fail-Safe Design:** Anticipate invalid API inputs and provide meaningful error messages.

## 4. Quality Assurance
- **Zero-Tolerance for Logic Errors:** Business logic and data consistency must be rigorously tested.
- **Performance Constraints:** Adhere to p95 < 1.0s for API responses (launcher), p95 < 1.5s for statistics.
- Security-first approach: Proper authentication, authorization, and data encryption (future).

## 5. Collaboration and Communication
- Clear documentation of decisions and changes.
- Standardized processes for team collaboration.
- Version control best practices with atomic commits.

## 6. Technical Excellence
- **Tech Stack Adherence:** Strict compliance with defined stack (Java 21/Spring Boot 4.0.1, MySQL 8.x).
- **Clean Code:** Focus on readability and maintainability following Spring Boot best practices.
- API-First design: RESTful APIs with proper versioning and documentation.

## 7. Project Lifecycle Management
- Clear definition of project phases (MVP vs Post-MVP).
- Systematic error handling and debugging.
- Continuous improvement processes.

## 8. Architecture Principles
- **Separation of Concerns:** Layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository).
- Design for scalability and maintainability.
- Implement proper exception handling with global exception handlers.

## 9. Code Quality Standards
- Follow consistent naming conventions.
- Write meaningful comments and documentation.
- Focus on code readability and maintainability.

## 10. Performance and Optimization
- Optimize database queries to minimize N+1 problems and reduce response times.
- Use proper indexing, connection pooling, and caching strategies.

## Implementation Guidelines
- Apply these principles consistently across all project phases.
- Adapt specific implementations based on project requirements.
- Maintain flexibility while adhering to core principles.
