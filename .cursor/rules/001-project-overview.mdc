# PROJECT OVERVIEW: Focus Habit Launcher Backend

## Vision
Help users with willpower depletion maintain consistent self-development habits by providing a backend API that supports habit tracking, alarm/notification management, and data visualization for mobile applications.

## Core Features
- **Habit Management API:** CRUD operations for user habits (meditation, reading, exercise, etc.)
- **Alarm/Timer Management:** Schedule and manage alarms/timers with notification integration
- **Session Logging:** Track habit execution sessions with timestamps and metadata
- **Statistics & Analytics:** Aggregate and visualize habit performance data (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)
- **Goal Management:** Set and track goals for each habit with achievement rate calculation
- **Data Export:** Export session logs to CSV/XLSX format
- **Quote Management:** Manage motivational quotes for NO flow

## Target Audience
- **Primary Users:** Knowledge workers (20s-40s) with willpower depletion who struggle to maintain focus
- **Mobile App Clients:** Android/iOS applications consuming REST API
- **Future:** Web dashboard, analytics tools

## Project Goals
- **Reliability:** 99.5% uptime, < 1s response time (p95) for critical endpoints
- **Data Integrity:** Zero data loss for habit logs and session records
- **Scalability:** Support future cloud backup and multi-device synchronization
- **Security:** Protect user data with encryption and secure authentication (future)

## Success Metrics (North Star: API Reliability)
- **API Response Time:** p95 < 1.0s for launcher screen, p95 < 1.5s for statistics
- **Data Reliability:** 99.5%+ successful session log saves
- **Error Rate:** < 0.5% failure rate for daily operations
- **Uptime:** 99.5% availability SLA

## Project Philosophy
- **Local-First:** MVP works offline with local database, cloud sync is optional enhancement
- **RESTful Design:** Clean, intuitive API following REST principles
- **Data Privacy:** Minimal data collection, user-controlled data export
- **Backward Compatibility:** Maintain API versioning for mobile app updates
