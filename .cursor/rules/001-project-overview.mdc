# PROJECT OVERVIEW: Focus Habit Launcher (Backend)

## Vision
A backend service for a habit launcher app designed for willpower-depleted knowledge workers. It helps users maintain focus and consistency by reducing digital distractions and providing a low-friction path to self-improvement activities.

## Core Features (Backend Scope)
- **Habit Management:** CRUD operations for user habits (Meditation, Reading, Exercise, etc.).
- **Alarm/Timer Management:** Fixed-time alarms, relative timers, labels, repeat patterns, OS notification integration.
- **Session Logging:** Secure storage and retrieval of habit execution logs (duration, timestamp, text/voice memo).
- **Analytics Engine:** Aggregation of daily/weekly/monthly/yearly statistics and streak calculation.
- **Goal Tracking:** Monitoring progress against user-defined targets (count or duration based).
- **Quote Service:** Management and serving of motivational quotes for the "NO" flow.
- **Data Export:** Generation of CSV/XLSX reports for user data.

## Target Audience
- **Knowledge Workers:** Struggle with digital distraction and decision fatigue.
- **ADHD Tendencies:** Need clear, immediate options without complexity.
- **Quantified Self Users:** Value objective data and progress visualization.

## Project Goals
- **Reliability:** Ensure 100% data integrity for user logs.
- **Performance:** Sub-second response for launcher initialization and log saving.
- **Scalability:** Design for future multi-device synchronization and cloud backup.

## Success Metrics
- **API Latency:** Launcher screen p95 < 1.0s, Statistics p95 < 1.5s.
- **Data Integrity:** 99.5%+ session log save success rate, Zero data loss.
- **Error Rate:** Less than 0.5% daily operation failures.
- **Availability:** 99.5% uptime SLA for API services.

## Project Philosophy
- **Local-First Support:** Backend acts as a sync/backup target (Future) or primary store depending on stage.
- **Privacy Centric:** Minimize data collection; secure storage of personal logs.
- **Simplicity:** API design should be straightforward and RESTful.
